  <h2>Cake</h2>
  <p>This zebra cake is an easy-to-make icebox cake. It seems to be as popular today as it was 50 years ago.</p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>1 ½ cups heavy whipping cream</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons confectioners' sugar</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
    <li>1 (9 ounce) package chocolate wafer cookies</li>
    <li>¼ cup grated chocolate</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
    <li>Beat cream in a chilled glass or metal bowl with an electric mixer. Gradually add confectioners' sugar and vanilla extract, continuing to beat until stiff peaks form.</li>
    <li>Spread a generous teaspoon of whipped cream onto each cookie.</li>
    <li>Press cookies together to make 3-inch stacks.</li>
    <li>Spread whipped cream in a 1-inch-wide line down the center of a serving platter. Turn cookie stacks sideways and join into a log; place in the whipped cream to secure.</li>
    <li>Frost cookie log with remaining whipped cream and sprinkle with grated chocolate. Cover tightly and refrigerate, 8 hours to overnight.</li>
    <li>To serve, slice diagonally to create striped pieces.</li>
  </ol>
