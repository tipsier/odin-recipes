  <h2>Cake</h2>
  <p>This easy ice cream cake has layers of ice cream sandwiches, hot fudge, caramel, and whipped topping. It was renamed as "The Best Dessert I've Ever Eaten" by my daughter this Memorial Day. My husband doesn't like when I take this dessert to a large gathering because it means he won't have any leftovers!</p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>24 vanilla ice cream sandwiches, unwrapped</li>
    <li>2 (8 ounce) containers whipped topping (such as Cool Whip®), thawed</li>
    <li>1 (12 ounce) jar hot fudge ice cream topping, warmed</li>
    <li>1 (12 ounce) jar caramel ice cream topping</li>
    <li>¼ cup chopped pecans, or to taste</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
    <li>Arrange a layer of ice cream sandwiches in the bottom of a 9x13-inch dish; top with a layer of whipped topping, hot fudge topping, and caramel topping.</li>
    <li>Repeat layering with remaining ice cream sandwiches, whipped topping, hot fudge topping, and caramel topping, ending with a top layer of whipped topping. Sprinkle with pecans.</li>
    <li>Cover the dish with aluminum foil and freeze until set, about 30 minutes. Slice and serve with your favorite toppings!</li>
